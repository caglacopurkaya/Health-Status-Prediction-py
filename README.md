# Health-Status-Prediction-py
I performed a predict operation using random forest regression in the dataset I used with symptoms and diseases, then I calculated the accuracy of these predictors and integrated them with the flask system to the website in my Health-Status-Predict repo. You can find the Flask structure in app.py
